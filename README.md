# Pythonic
It\`s a C++ library which provides basic 
I use it in all of my C++ projects in order to simplify all aspects of work.

## Features:
- Multidimensional Array class
- Tools to deal with encodings:
    - My C++ wrapper around WinAPI for converting between UTF-8, UTF-16 (windows system encoding), and CP-1251 (one-byte cyrillic encoding)
    - Automatic encoding determination (UTF-8, CP-1251 and pure ASCII)
    - Automatic recoding to one of those encodings (UTF-8, CP-1251 and pure ASCII)
- Utilities to deal with letters
